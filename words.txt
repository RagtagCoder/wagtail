iv had a lot to do. I give up, I wish I could be honest with you but you'll use anything against me and with your new found friendships I just can't trust you anymore. Its sad the way things have turned out and I'm sorry for my part in that. I nearly reached out to you Sunday night but I'm glad I didn't now. I believed everything you said and it just feels like you were only saying any of it to get me on side for your schedule and as soon as I didn't agree we have this again. I will do anything for my kids, you know this and all of this is just too much now so it's time for me to get off this circus ride, I wish you all the happiness in the world and I just hope you feel you've made the right decisions. Good luck with everything going forward and no I won't fight the divorce, just don't put any bullshit reasons please and we'll have no problems with that. It's time for me to step away now, I can't continue on with all this anger and upset day in day out
